Welcome to the thirtyonsix.com repository. If you are reading this, I applaud you for your research. Feel free to look around. I'm not entirely sure why you would be interested in looking around my site's code, but there is no judgment here. To each their own.

30 On Six is a project I started as a junior at Syracuse University. It is a monthly playlist highlighting 30 songs, primarily hip-hop, that I feel deserve to be recognized. The website serves as a place where people can read the blog posts for each month's playlist and view previous months' playlists. Everything you see has been curated, photographed, and designed by yours truly, other than the music of course.

I started this for two reasons. One, I would say my music taste is a bit niche, and if I can do something to "convert" more mainstream listeners to the music I constantly surround myself in, that just means there are more people for me to nerd out with. Two, 30 On Six is a way for me to hold myself accountable and continue to grow as a designer, as a photographer, and as a writer. The only way to get better at anything is to keep putting in the reps, and each month is an opportunity for me to set a new PB and keep progressing. 

I am by no means an expert coder, so if you see something that I should change feel free to reach out to pfirrell@thirtyonsix.com. I hope you enjoy looking around but above all, I hope you find some new music to add to your rotation.

P.F.
